# Add regional director role #

Websocket notifications not beign sent
A restau must have a branch before another restau can be created within thesame company. Restau owners can't create restaus
Restrict creation of companyadmin and restauowner. Ownership can be transfered through an email - receipient would accept the ownership transfer for it to take effect.
  companyadmin can ad another same role, restau owner can only transfer ownership
    for compadmin they need to add the user first as a countrymanager and then send them an invite to be a compadmin (no direct creation) - i think it should be same for restauowner (they create the user as branchmanager and send transfer of ownership invitation)
    companyadmin sends an invitation to join, restauowner sends a transer of ownership

- View to assign managers and users to branches/restaurant
  PERM
    Must be in BranchManger group
    Must be in branch/restau scope
- Complete View to transfer users within branches

  Can be done in single steps - escalate notifications up the hierachy when it happens
